## 📁 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects that highlight what I do:

- 📌 [**Project Wolfgang**](https://github.com/jp-asadon/project-wolfgang)  
  A full-stack event evaluation system built for a software design course. Features include CRUD operations, IP-based access control, QR code generation, and visualized event summaries.
- 📌 [**SAT Score Analysis**](https://github.com/jp-asadon/sat_scores)  
  Cleaned and analyzed NYC SAT data from Kaggle. Includes insights like top boroughs in verbal scores, racial distribution, average scores by borough, and school enrollment statistics.
- 📌 [**Strawberry Disease Detection with YOLOv5 + ROS2**](https://github.com/ianueph/strawberry-picking-rpi): A real-time ML + robotics integration using Raspberry Pi Programmed using ROS2 Jazzy and Python.
- 📌 [**Spotify Listening History Analysis**](https://github.com/jp-asadon/spotify_analysis)
  A deep-dive analysis into years of personal Spotify usage and user behavior based on detailed playback history. This project analyzes trends across time, artist and track popularity, skippability, and how listening habits changed during the COVID-19 lockdown.

## ☕ Fun Facts (Beyond Coding)

- 🎶 My guilty pleasure playlist? Full of 2010–2018 nostalgia — 1D, The Vamps, Taylor Swift, Little Mix… and yes, some K-pop too.
- 🎬 Total geek for superhero movies — DC or Marvel? I say both. Midnight premieres? Count me in.
- 😂 I unwind with sitcoms — the older, the cheesier, the better. (Friends, HIMYM, Modern Family, Brooklyn Nine-Nine!)
- 📱 I’ve tried building productivity systems I never stick to (but hey, Notion dashboards are ✨ aesthetic).
- 🌍 If I weren’t coding, I’d probably be storyboarding a webtoon or writing movie reviews.
