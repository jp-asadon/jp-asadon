## 📁 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects that highlight what I do:

- 📌 [**Project Wolfgang**](https://github.com/jp-asadon/project-wolfgang)  
  A full-stack event evaluation system built for a software design course. Features include CRUD operations, IP-based access control, QR code generation, and visualized event summaries.
- 📌 [**SAT Score Analysis**](https://github.com/jp-asadon/sat_scores)  
  Cleaned and analyzed NYC SAT data from Kaggle. Includes insights like top boroughs in verbal scores, racial distribution, average scores by borough, and school enrollment statistics.
- 📌 [**Strawberry Disease Detection with YOLOv5 + ROS2**](https://github.com/ianueph/strawberry-picking-rpi): A real-time ML + robotics integration using Raspberry Pi Programmed using ROS2 Jazzy and Python.
- 📌 [**Netflix Data Cleaning & Visualization**](#): Basic data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling with Python & pandas *(coming soon)*
